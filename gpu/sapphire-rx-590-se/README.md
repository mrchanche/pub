# Sapphire Radeon RX 590 Nitro+ Special Edition

- Brand: Sapphire
- GPU: Radeon RX 590
- Model: Nitro+ Special Edition

### Thermal Pad Sizes

- VRAM: .75mm
- VRM: .5mm
- Back Plate: 1mm and .5mm

### How do you get an RX 590?

- RX 480 14nm
    - OC it
        - RX 580 14nm
            - Shrink node to 12nm
                - OC it
                    - RX 590 12nm

### Does this card work in 2025

Yes, it does just fine on 1080p for DCS World 2.9, Cyberpunk 2077, Stellar Blade, Battlefield 6 all with low settings and FSR quality.

### Required Tools For Disassembly

- Tools
    - PH1 driver
    - PH00 driver (Only used for backplate heat spreader)
    - 5mm driver (DVI lugs on IO shield)

### Disassembly

This is very straight forward, all screws can be taken out with a PH1 driver, with the 3 tiny screws on the backplate needing an PH00. Those screws hold a heat spreader to the backplate.

### Backside VRM Heatspreader

- **Backplate**
- .5mm thermal pad (or thermal putty, use thin stuff like Halzyie)
- **Aluminum Heat Spreader**
- 1mm thermal pad
- **Backside of PCB**

### Thermal Pad Thickness

- VRAM
    - .75mm
        - Measured at .025" / .635mm
- MOSFETs
    - .5mm
        - Measured at .016" / .406mm
- Backplate Heatspreader
    - Backplate side
        - 1mm
            - Measured at .031" / .787mm
    - PCB side
        - .5mm
            - Measured at .013" / .33mm
                - These were very squished, it would be fine to use a thin putty or even thermal paste here as this is not critical whatsoever
