Public facing things/docs/testing... shifting things around to make this a bit cleaner.

### <a href="/system-setup">system-setup</a>

I roll through a good deal of hardware yearly, this is a place to keep my configs, scripts etc...

### <a href="/gpu">gpu</a>

Just tracking some gpu specific data here.

### <a href="/benchmark">benchmark</a>

Currently a heat generator targeting tokenization performance over the last couple years. The code only functions to time GPUs under a specific load. I would like to add additional benchmarks here and expand the dataset. 

### <a href="/ai-ml">ai-ml</a>

General storage for pytorch/tensorflow/keras examples as I switch between nvidia, amd, and intel GPUs. 

### <a href="/thermal-archive">thermal-archive</a>

A project which I feel I finished, tracking and test a large amount of thermal interfaces at multiple wattages. This project has several iterations over the last few years including automated pumpout testing, heat cycling but this is the last snapshop of the latest iterations of the testing.

### <a href="/ps-media-convert">ps-media-convert</a>

This was my first trip through Powershell, I used it to build a plex media compression server that monitors for media, resizes, tags, and tracks saved space across my NAS with a simple webpage to monitor.

### <a href="/newb-typer">newb-typer</a>

I just needed a simple retro typing program to get used to new keyboards as I swap between micro KB, TLK, full size etc...
