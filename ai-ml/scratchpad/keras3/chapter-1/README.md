# Chapter 1 - Introduction

Just a literal intro to the book.

**Deep** in deep-learning represents many layer of precessing that transform input into very sophisticated representations.

Keras specifics, why use it:

- removes a lot of boilerplate
- efficient performance
- fairly backwards compatible
- very high level abstraction
- flexible, it can expose the details if needed
- pipelines can be 30 lines of code end to end

Keras still requires understand deep learning concepts.

Chaper layout:

- 2 intro to ml
- 3 fundamentals of gradient descent
- 4 classification via gradient descent
- 5 keras deep dive
- 6 regularization techniques
- 7 CNN
- 8 APIs of keras
- 9 transformers
- 10 reinforcement learning
- 11 autoencoders and generative 
- 12 advanced generatives
- 13 recap

The book is basically laid out similarly as many other pytorch specific books. The book will not even get into using ML or installing keras until Chapter 5. The first 166 or so pages is just conceptual.

In earliar chapters before keras specifics it looks like most of the examples are vanilla python and mathematics.
