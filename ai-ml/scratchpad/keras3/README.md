# Keras 3 - The Comprehensive Guide to Deep Learning with the Keras API and Python

This book is brand new, released in late Oct 2025 from sap-press.com. Looks interesting, I somewhat understand what keras3 is but I have no direct experience with higher layer frameworks that sit on top of existing ml frameworks.

This will track my notes in MD format.
